nest_dg_ca3_fi_calibration.py
==============================
NEST 3.9 confirmation of the DG-CA3 extension's single-neuron f-I
calibration (Phase 6.1). Run on MN5 to confirm/replace the numbers
derived from the numpy Izhikevich stand-in (izh_calibrate.py) BEFORE
they are written into build_dg_ca3_network() (Phase 6.2).

Populations calibrated here:
  PPGC_HGC : RS granule cell  (a=0.02, b=0.2, c=-65, d=8,  I_e=0)
             HGC and PPGC given IDENTICAL intrinsic parameters -- per
             Kassab & Alexandre 2018 the PPGC/HGC distinction is a
             connectivity/recruitment distinction (both are DG granule
             cells), not an intrinsic-electrophysiology one.
  DG_BASKET: FS interneuron    (a=0.10, b=0.2, c=-65, d=2,  I_e=0)
             reused verbatim from existing basket_params.
  MC_LOW   : RS + I_e=0.0     -- low-threshold mossy cell
  MC_HIGH  : RS + I_e=-9.0    -- high-threshold mossy cell
             tuned to reproduce Kassab & Alexandre's own theta_l=0.1 /
             theta_h=0.5 ratio (5.0x) under the numpy stand-in; this
             script confirms whether that ratio holds under NEST's
             actual solver.

Output
------
Raw data (NOT just plots) is written to HDF5, following the same
schema philosophy as save_replay_hdf5() in replay_scaled.py: root
attrs + one group per population with attrs (intrinsic params,
rheobase) and datasets (per-rate response curve + raw spike times/
senders, compressed). This keeps simulation (NEST, on MN5) and
analysis (numpy/h5py, local) separated, matching the project's
established HDF5 pipeline.

CLI mirrors replay_scaled.py conventions: --threads, --out-hdf5,
--no-figures.

Sweep resolution (2026-07-22 revision)
--------------------------------------
The first MN5 run (res/2026-07-22/dg_ca3_fi_calib.h5) returned an identical
200 Hz rheobase for all four populations and mc_high_low_ratio = 1.00,
tripping the [FLAG] check. That was a measurement artifact, not a
disconfirmation of the parameter sets:

  * --rate-step was 200 Hz, so the first non-zero grid point was 200 Hz;
  * --criterion-hz was 2.0 Hz, which every population already exceeded at
    that first point (MC ~15-25 Hz, DG_BASKET ~85 Hz).

Rheobase was therefore floored at the grid's first point for all four, which
is indistinguishable from "all equal" in the saved summary -- even though the
f-I curves are visibly separated everywhere above threshold.

Four changes address this:
  1. build_rate_grid() -- fine grid (default 20 Hz) up to --fine-rate-max,
     coarse grid (default 200 Hz) above it, so the threshold region is
     resolved without paying for a fine sweep out to 6.2 kHz.
  2. rheobase_rate() interpolates between bracketing grid points instead of
     snapping to the first point at or above criterion.
  3. threshold_by_extrapolation() supplies the primary, criterion-free
     metric, and now drives the [OK]/[FLAG] verdict. A criterion-based
     rheobase measures `threshold + criterion/gain`, so the ratio it yields
     is biased toward 1.0 and CANNOT test the 5.0x target: on a synthetic
     pair with a true 5.00x ratio the measured value is 4.13x at a 1 Hz
     criterion and 2.06x at 10 Hz. Raising the criterion makes this worse,
     not better -- the fix for the 2026-07-22 run is the finer grid, not a
     higher criterion, which is why --criterion-hz stays at 2.0.
  4. Every run reports the ratio across a criterion ladder (CRITERIA_HZ) as
     a diagnostic, so the criterion-dependence is visible rather than
     implicit.

check_grid_resolves_criterion() now warns explicitly when the floor
condition recurs, so a future run cannot fail this way silently.

DC current probe (2026-07-23 revision)
--------------------------------------
The finer sweep above resolved the threshold region (res/2026-07-23) and in
doing so exposed a deeper problem: the extrapolated threshold is undefined
for every population, because every linear fit extrapolates to a negative
drive rate. At 20 Hz drive PPGC_HGC already fires at 8.75 Hz -- roughly 44%
of input spikes evoke an output spike.

The cause is the probe, not the sweep. Solving the Izhikevich fixed points
(0.04 v^2 + (5-b) v + 140 + I_e = 0) puts MC_LOW's rest at -70.00 mV and its
threshold at -50.00 mV, a gap of exactly 20.00 mV -- identical to the
--weight 20.0 probe's single-EPSP amplitude. Single inputs are therefore
suprathreshold, the cell relays rather than integrates, and "rheobase in Hz
of Poisson drive" measures the probe rather than the neuron. No rate grid,
however fine, can fix that.

--probe dc measures rheobase the way Watson et al. (~77 vs ~128 pA) and
Kassab & Alexandre (theta_l / theta_h) define it: by current injection. For
Izhikevich this has a closed form (analytic_dc_rheobase), which the sweep
reports alongside the measured value as a solver cross-check:

    I_rheo = (5 - b)^2 / 0.16 - 140 - I_e

MC_LOW -> 4.00 and MC_HIGH at I_e=-9.0 -> 13.00, a ratio of 3.25x (3.38x
under forward Euler) -- outside the +/-20% band, so the 5.0x target failed
and the numpy stand-in in izh_calibrate.py did overestimate the separation.
MC_HIGH's I_e is retuned to -15.1, which gives 5.00x numerically; the NEST
DC sweep is the arbiter.

Incidental: DG_BASKET has the same -70/-50 geometry as the granule cells.
Its ~6x steeper f-I gain comes from d=2.0 (weak adaptation), not from a
lower threshold -- FS cells here are higher-gain, not more excitable.

    it produces is biased toward 1.0, and the bias grows with the criterion:

    the measured ratio is 4.13x at a 1 Hz criterion but only 2.06x at 10 Hz.
